        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p>Hi guys, we are going to learn about pollution in this blog. There are many types of pollution but mainly four of them are 
           more dangerous to  us. That are Water pollution, Air Pollution, Soid Pollution and Noise Pollution. <br> Environmental Pollution 
           influences the quality of natureâ€™s life more than one can assume. It acts in unnatural ways, sometimes which cannot be viewed by 
           the open eye. Though, it is very much existing in the atmosphere. For example, you might not be capable to see the natural gases 
           (oxygen, Carbon-dioxide) present in the air, although they are still existing. Furthermore, the pollutants which are slaughtering
            the air and raising the levels of carbon dioxide are very critical for humans. Raised levels of carbon dioxide will lead to
             global warming </p>

        <p>After discovering the harmful effects of pollution, one should perform the task of stopping or decreasing pollution as soon
             as possible. To overcome air pollution, people should start taking public transport such as buses, auto-rickshaws, pool-cabs 
             to reduce pollution generated by vehicles. Try to avoid bursting crackers especially at the time of festivals which causes a 
             huge amount of toxic pollution in the air. Avoiding crackers will also help to reduce noise pollution. Foremost is we must 
             foster the habit of recycling. All the used plastic materials are been dumped in the oceans and land, which causes pollution. 
             Therefore, we should not dispose of such toxic materials off after use, instead, reuse them as long as you can.</p>

        <p>Everyone must step towards development ranging from individuals to the industries. As dealing with this problem calls for 
            a collective effort, so we must unite and work for it. Furthermore, the lives of innocent animals are being lost because of
             such human actions. So, all of us must come and together and take a stand to become a voice for the unheard and making this 
             earth pollution-free.</p>
